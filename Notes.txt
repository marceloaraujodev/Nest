Service -> Logic  | also is kind of the provider
Controller -> Route Handlers | handles incoming HTTP requests,
Modules -> Organizer

Creating a route:

  we type in the terminal
    nest g module <module name> creates the folder with the module file
      in the module we need to add the controllers and providers both empty arrays to the @Module!
    nest g controller<name of route> (where we define the endpoints)
    nest g service <name of service> (where the main logic is)


Controller

  🔸 Controllers: Where you define the endpoints (like GET /users or POST /users).
  🔸 Services: Where the main logic goes (business logic, database operations, etc.) provider is the services
  🔸 Modules: These tie everything together.
      -A module organizes controllers and services into logical units.
      -You define a UsersModule where you register the UsersController and UsersService
